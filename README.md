# Blackjack ‚úåüèΩ
Full stack desktop application based on a problem set I did during my first year of college studying computer science. It uses a GUI (JavaFX), a database (MongoDB), and a backend supported by Java code. This was a very informative experience; I gained skills including but not limited to: Database interaction, GUI, Advanced Java principles, and caveats surrounding program structure. Being that this was one of my very first projects, I found it to be difficult to learn how to add dependencies, how to use build tools such as Maven and how to interact with MongoDB. However, with research and further reading I came to learn these skills and am very grateful for the experience!
